I don't think github pays attention to ssh keys
After failing to push with ssh public key copied into github I generated a token as per
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
And then said:

ian@star Doc % git push
Username for 'https://github.com': stellated
Password for 'https://stellated@github.com': <pasted the token here>

I had to use the token again to push with PyCharm, so I need to save it somewhere.
It's in ~/.zshrc
